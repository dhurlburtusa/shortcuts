# Terminology Notes


## Container or Wrapper?

Many times container and wrapper are used interchangeably in the HTML markup and
CSS world to describe a parent element.  However, starting now, I'll use them as
follows.

**Container**

A container is a parent element that contains contains zero or more related
child elements.

**Wrapper**

A wrapper is a parent element that wraps a specific child element.  Many times
a wrapper element is needed to get the desired layout of the child element when
the child element cannot do it on its own.

One example off the top of my head is a dialog.  Sometimes a wrapper is needed
to get it to position/layout where you want.
