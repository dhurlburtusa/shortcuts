# Ionic Notes

Ionic Framework is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with integrations for popular frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.


**One codebase, running everywhere**

Ionic is the only mobile app stack that enables web developers to build apps for all major app stores and the mobile web from a single codebase. And with [Adaptive Styling](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/platform-styles), Ionic apps look and feel at home on every device.


## Environment Setup

Node and npm are the only requirements.

**Terminal**

- Recommends using the built-in terminals.
- Git Bash (from git-scm.com) does not support TTY interactivity and is not supported by Ionic.
