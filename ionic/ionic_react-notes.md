# Ionic React Notes

Ionic React is native React version of Ionic Framework.

Ionic React projects are just like React projects, leveraging react-dom and with setup normally found in a Create React App (CRA) app. For routing and navigation, React Router is used under the hood. Compatible with React version 16.8 and above.

Ionic React projects can be deployed to native iOS, Android, Electron, and the web as a Progressive Web App, using Capacitor, a modern native runtime. All with one shared codebase.
