# Wordpress REST API Notes

The WordPress REST API provides API endpoints for WordPress data types such as
posts, pages, media, tags, categories, users, etc.

## Routes & Endpoints

A route is a URI which can be mapped to different HTTP methods. The mapping of
an individual HTTP method to a route is known as an "endpoint".

If we make a GET request to http://oursite.com/wp-json/, we will get a JSON
response showing us what routes are available.

A list of routes for WordPress can be found at
