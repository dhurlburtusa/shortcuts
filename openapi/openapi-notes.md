# OpenAPI Notes

The OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking
industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how REST
APIs are described.

APIs form the connecting glue between modern applications.  Nearly every
application uses APIs to connect with corporate data sources, third party data
services or other applications.  Creating an open description format for API
services that is vendor neutral, portable and open is critical to accelerating
the vision of a truly connected world.
