# Apollo Client Notes

Apollo Client is the best way to use GraphQL to build client applications.  The
client is designed to help you quickly build a UI that fetches data with
GraphQL, and can be used with any JavaScript front-end.  The client is:

- **Incrementally adoptable**: You can drop it into an existing app today.
- **Universally compatible**: Apollo works with any build setup, any GraphQL
  server, and any GraphQL schema.
- **Simple to get started with**: Start loading data right away and learn about
  advanced features later.
- **Inspectable and understandable**: Interrogate and understand exactly what is
  happening in an application.
- **Built for interactive apps**: Application users make changes and see them
  reflected immediately.
- **Small and flexible**: You don’t get stuff your application doesn’t need.
- **Community driven**: Apollo is driven by the community and serves a variety
  of use cases.
