# Make Notes

Make is a tool which is typically used to control the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files. More generally, Make can be used to run a series of instructions depending on what files have changed.


## Makefiles

Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled.

It can be used beyond programs too, when you need a series of instructions to run depending on what files have changed.
