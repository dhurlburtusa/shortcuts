# Cracking the Coding Interview Notes


## Interview Questions

### Arrays and Strings

1.1 **Is Unique**

- Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

1.2 **Check Permutations**

- Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

1.3 **URLify**

- Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.

1.4 **Palindrome Permutation**

- Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
