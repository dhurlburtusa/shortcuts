# Cracking the Coding Interview Notes


## Big O

Used to describe the runtime and space complexity of an algorithm.

**Big O, Big Theta, Bit Omega**

In academics, there are actually three "Bigs". In software development, usually only Big O is of importance.

- **Big O** Describes the upper bound on the time.
- **Big Omega** Describes the lower bound on the time.
- **Big Theta** It means both Big O and Big Ω. That is, an algorithm is Θ(N) if it is both O(N) and Ω(N).

**Best Case, Worst Case, and Expected Case**

These are the three ways the runtime for an algorithm can be described.

## Interview Questions

### Arrays and Strings

1.1 **Is Unique**

- Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

1.2 **Check Permutations**

- Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

1.3 **URLify**

- Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.

1.4 **Palindrome Permutation**

- Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
