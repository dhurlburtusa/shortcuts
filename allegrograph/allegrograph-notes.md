# AllegroGraph Notes

AllegroGraph is a database and application framework for building Semantic Web applications. It can store data and meta-data as triples; query these triples through various query APIs like SPARQL; and apply RDFS++ reasoning with its built-in reasoner.

AllegroGraph is a high-performance database built to hold this information, query it, and reason with it.
