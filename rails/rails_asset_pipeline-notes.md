# Rails Asset Pipeline Notes

The asset pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets. It also adds the ability to write these assets in other languages and pre-processors such as CoffeeScript, Sass, and ERB. It allows assets in your application to be automatically combined with assets from other gems.

See https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html for details.
