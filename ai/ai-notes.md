# AI Notes

- Began using set rules and patterns, mindlessly matching patterns
- Chinese room argument
  + 1980, philosopher John Searle
- Weak vs strong AI
- Symbolic systems
- Expert systems
- Combinatorial explosion
  
## Machine Learning

Learn by sensing data. Learn by "experience". Different from symbolic systems, still just identifying patterns.

Machine learning systems feed on data to learn new things.

### Learning Strategies

<dl>
  <dt>Supervised learning</dt>
  <dd>A data scientist acts like a tutor for the machine. They show the machine the correct answers and then let the system train itself to get better. Needs to have a knowledgeable tutor.</dd>

  <dt>Unsupervised learning</dt>
  <dd>The machine makes all the observations on its own. Needs access to a lot of good data.</dd>

## Artificial Neural Network

AI system that mimics the structure of the human brain.

Input layer, hidden layers , output layer.

Machine learning system. Basically, makes guesses and compares those guesses to the correct answer.

Is trained with different input data. Adjusts hidden layer to improve output layer.

## Natural Language Processing

This is when you interact with the machine using your own natural language.

Uses machine learning and artificial neural networks.
