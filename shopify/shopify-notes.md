# Shopify Notes

> Shopify enables you to create powerful ecommerce solutions for a variety of scenarios, including integrating your service into the Shopify admin, customizing any website, and more.


## App Types

You can create three different types of apps for Shopify stores: public, custom, and private. App types can't be changed after the app has been created.

**Public Apps**

A public Shopify app interacts with the Shopify API on behalf of multiple stores. All public apps need to go through Shopifyâ€™s review process.

**Custom Apps**

Custom Shopify apps interact with the Shopify API on behalf of a single store. The store's Shopify URL `example.myshopify.com` is provided on app creation and can't be changed. Custom apps are not listed on the Shopify App Store and do not require a Shopify app review.

**Private Apps**

Private apps interact with the Shopify API on behalf of a single store. Private apps are created in the Shopify admin, and are not listed on the Shopify App Store. Private apps do not require a Shopify app review.
