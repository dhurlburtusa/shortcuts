# Auth0 Notes

Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications.

You can connect any application to Auth0 and define the identity providers you want to use.

Based on your app's technology, choose one of the SDKs (or call the API) and hook it up to your app. Now each time a user tries to authenticate, Auth0 will verify their identity and send the required information back to your app.
