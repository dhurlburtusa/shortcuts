# Nx Notes

Nx is a smart build system and task orchestrator that understands how your code is built, used, and shared. It helps teams scale confidently by running only what’s needed, enforcing best practices, and keeping builds fast and reliable—both locally and in CI. Nx also structures your metadata to power consistent, AI-assisted workflows across your entire development pipeline.
