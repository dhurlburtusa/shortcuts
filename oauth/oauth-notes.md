# OAuth 2.0 Notes

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

OAuth is a service that is complementary to and distinct from [OpenID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID).

OAuth is directly related to [OpenID Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) (OIDC), since OIDC is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0.

[RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) defines the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework.
