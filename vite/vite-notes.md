# Vite Notes

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

## Browser Support

During development, Vite sets `esnext` as the transform target, because we assume a modern browser is used and it supports all of the latest JavaScript and CSS features. This prevents syntax lowering, letting Vite serve modules as close as possible to the original source code.

For the production build, by default Vite targets browsers that support native ES Modules, native ESM dynamic import, and import.meta. Legacy browsers can be supported via the official [@vitejs/plugin-legacy](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy). See the [Building for Production](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html) section for more details.
