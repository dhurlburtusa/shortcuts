# Fullscreen Notes

From [MDN]:

> The Fullscreen API provides an easy way for web content to be presented using
> the user's entire screen.  The API lets you easily direct the browser to make
> an element and its children, if any, occupy the fullscreen, eliminating all
> browser user interface and other applications from the screen for the
> duration.
