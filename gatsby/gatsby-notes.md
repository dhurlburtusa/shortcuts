# Gatsby Notes

[Gatsby] is a blazing fast modern site generator for React.


## Getting Started

**Create a new Site**

```sh
# Syntax
npx gatsby new <site-proj-dir-name> [<url-to-gatsby-starter>]

# Example
npx gatsby new hello-world https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```


## Common Commands

**Developing with a Live Reloading HMR**

```sh
gatsby develop
```

I recommend making this an npm strict so you can use `npm start` to run the above command.

**Create a Production Build**

```sh
gatsby build
```

**Serve the Production Build Locally**

```sh
gatsby serve
```
