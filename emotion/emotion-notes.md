# Emotion Notes

Emotion is a library designed for writing css styles with JavaScript. It provides powerful and predictable style composition in addition to a great developer experience with features such as source maps, labels, and testing utilities. Both string and object styles are supported.

There are two primary methods of using Emotion. The first is framework agnostic and the second is for use with React.

**Framework Agnostic**

```sh
npm i @emotion/css
```

See [@emotion/css](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/css) for more info.

**React**

```sh
npm i @emotion/react
```

See [@emotion/react](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/react) for more info.
