# RDF Schema Notes

RDF Schema provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data. RDF Schema is a semantic extension of the basic RDF vocabulary. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF Schema is written in RDF. These resources are used to determine characteristics of other resources, such as the domains and ranges of properties.

The RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type systems of object-oriented programming languages. RDF Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a class in terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema describes properties in terms of the classes of resource to which they apply. This is the role of the domain and range mechanisms. Using the RDF approach, it is easy for others to subsequently define additional properties to domains.
