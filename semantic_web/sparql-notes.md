# SPARQL 1.1 Notes

SPARQL 1.1 is a set of specifications that provide languages and protocols to query and manipulate RDF graph content on the Web or in an RDF store.

- [SPARQL 1.1 Query Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) - A query language for RDF.
- [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results JSON Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/) and [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results CSV and TSV Formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/) - Apart from the standard SPARQL Query Results XML Format [SPARQL-XML-Result], SPARQL 1.1 now allows three alternative popular formats to exchange answers to SPARQL queries, namely JSON, CSV (comma separated values) and TSV (tab separated values) which are described in these two documents.
- [SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/) - A specification defining an extension of the SPARQL 1.1 Query Language for executing queries distributed over different SPARQL endpoints.
- [SPARQL 1.1 Entailment Regimes](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-entailment/) - A specification defining the semantics of SPARQL queries under entailment regimes such as RDF Schema, OWL, or RIF.
- [SPARQL 1.1 Update Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) - An update language for RDF graphs.
- [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol for RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) - A protocol defining means for conveying arbitrary SPARQL queries and update requests to a SPARQL service.
- [SPARQL 1.1 Service Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/) - A specification defining a method for discovering and a vocabulary for describing SPARQL services.
- [SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store HTTP Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/) - As opposed to the full SPARQL protocol, this specification defines minimal means for managing RDF graph content directly via common HTTP operations.
- SPARQL 1.1 Test Cases - A suite of tests, helpful for understanding corner cases in the specification and assessing whether a system is SPARQL 1.1 conformant
