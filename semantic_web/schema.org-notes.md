# Schema.org Notes

Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.


## Data Model

The data model used is very generic and derived from [RDF Schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF_Schema).

Types are arranged in a multiple inheritance hierarchy where each type may be a sub-class of multiple types.

Properties may have one or more types as its domains. Properties may have one or more types as its ranges.

See https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html.
