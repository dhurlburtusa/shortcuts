# OWL 2 Notes

OWL 2 is designed to facilitate ontology development and sharing via the Web, with the ultimate goal of making Web content more accessible to machines.


## Ontologies

Ontologies are formalized vocabularies of terms, often covering a specific domain and shared by a community of users. They specify the definitions of terms by describing their relationships with other terms in the ontology.

The conceptual structure of OWL 2 ontologies is defined in the OWL 2 Structural Specification document.

Any OWL 2 ontology can also be viewed as an RDF graph.

OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals, and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents.

OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents.
