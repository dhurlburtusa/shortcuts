# Provenance Notes

Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability, or trustworthiness. The PROV Family of Documents defines a model, corresponding serializations, and other supporting definitions to enable the inter-operable interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous environments such as the Web.
