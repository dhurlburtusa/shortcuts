# Electron Notes

Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.


## Application Architecture

Composed of two process types:

**Main Process**

The process that runs `package.json`'s main script is called the main process. The script that runs in the main process can display a GUI by creating web pages. An Electron app always has one main process, but never more.

**Renderer Process**

Since Electron uses Chromium for displaying web pages, Chromium's multi-process architecture is also used. Each web page in Electron runs in its own process, which is called the renderer process.

The main process creates web pages by creating BrowserWindow instances. Each BrowserWindow instance runs the web page in its own renderer process. When a BrowserWindow instance is destroyed, the corresponding renderer process is also terminated.

In web pages, calling native GUI related APIs is not allowed because managing native GUI resources in web pages is very dangerous and it is easy to leak resources. If you want to perform GUI operations in a web page, the renderer process of the web page must communicate with the main process to request that the main process perform those operations.


## Using Electron APIs

Electron offers a number of APIs that support the development of a desktop application in both the main process and the renderer process. In both processes, you'd access Electron's APIs by requiring its included module:

```js
const electron = require('electron')
```

See https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-architecture#using-electron-apis for details.


## Using Node.js APIs

Electron exposes full access to Node.js both in the main and the renderer process. This has two important implications:

1) All APIs available in Node.js are available in Electron. Calling the following code from an Electron app works:

```
const fs = require('fs')

const root = fs.readdirSync('/')

// This will print all files at the root-level of the disk,
// either '/' or 'C:\'.
console.log(root)
```

2) You can use Node.js modules in your application. Pick your favorite npm module. npm offers currently the world's biggest repository of open-source code â€“ the ability to use well-maintained and tested code that used to be reserved for server applications is one of the key features of Electron.

As an example, to use the official AWS SDK in your application, you'd first install it as a dependency:

```
npm install --save aws-sdk
```
