# GPT Notes

OpenAI's GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models have been trained to understand natural language and code. GPTs provide text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to GPTs are also referred to as "prompts".

To use a GPT model via the OpenAI API, you’ll send a request containing the inputs and your API key, and receive a response containing the model’s output. The latest models, gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo, are accessed through the chat completions API endpoint.
