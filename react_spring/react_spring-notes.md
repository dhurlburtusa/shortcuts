# react-spring Notes

`react-spring` is a spring-physics based animation library that should cover most of your UI related animation needs. It gives you tools flexible enough to confidently cast your ideas into moving interfaces.

`react-spring` is cross platform, it supports the web, react-native, react-native-web and practically any other platform, we have specifically exported the following targets

```
@react-spring/konva
@react-spring/native
@react-spring/three
@react-spring/web
@react-spring/zdog
```

Traditional animation libraries work in terms of time (duration) and curves. `react-spring`, however, works in terms of a spring. A spring simply animates values from one state to another.
