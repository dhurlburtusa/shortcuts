# Rust Notes

Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

By striving for zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features that compile to lower-level code as fast as code written manually, Rust endeavors to make safe code be fast code as well.

Rust's greatest ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers have accepted for decades by providing safety and productivity, speed and ergonomics.

## Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain data type and be either scalar or compound.

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

### Scalar Types

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: booleans, characters, floating-point numbers, and integers.

#### Boolean

Rust's boolean type is `bool` and has two possible values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are one byte in size.

#### Character

Rust's character type is `char` and are four bytes in size, representing a Unicode Scalar Value.

#### Floating-Point Types

Rust's floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`.

#### Integer Types

**Variants**

| Length  | Signed               | Unsigned             |
| ------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 8-bit   | i8                   | u8                   |
| 16-bit  | i16                  | u16                  |
| 32-bit  | i32                  | u32                  |
| 64-bit  | i64                  | u64                  |
| 128-bit | i128                 | u128                 |
| arch    | isize (pointer size) | usize (pointer size) |

**Syntax**

| Syntax  | Example     |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Binary  | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte    | b'A'        |
| Decimal | 98_222      |
| Hex     | 0xff        |
| Octal   | 0o77        |

### Strings

**Misc**

- String literals have type `&'static str`. `&'static str` is a reference to a string allocated in read only memory.

### Compound Types

Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two _primitive_ compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### Tuples

A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```

#### Arrays

An array is a collection of multiple values with the **same** type. Arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

#### Structs

A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group.

### Misc

#### Casting

Rust provides no implicit type conversion (coercion) between primitive types. But, explicit type conversion (casting) can be performed using the `as` keyword.

There are limitations in conversion rules. A float cannot be directly converted to a char.

#### Type Aliases

The `type` statement can be used to give a new name to an existing type. Types must have PascalCase names, or the compiler will raise a warning. The exception to this rule are the primitive types: `usize`, `f32`, etc.

```rust
enum VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers {
    Add,
    Subtract,
}

// Creates a type alias
type Operations = VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers;

fn main() {
    // We can refer to each variant via its alias, not its long and inconvenient
    // name.
    let x = Operations::Add;
}
```

## Structs

A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group.

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username,
        email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    let user2 = build_user(String::from("someone@example.com"), String::from("someusername123"));

    let user3 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        // struct update syntax
        ..user2
    };
}
```

```rust
use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Pair<T> {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

// The following only implements the `cmp_display` method on `Pair`'s if the inner
// type `T` implements both the `PartialOrd` trait and the `Display` trait.
impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
    fn cmp_display(&self) {
        if self.x >= self.y {
            println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
        } else {
            println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
        }
    }
}
```

## Constants

Constants in Rust are declared with the `const` keyword and the type of the value _must_ be annotated. Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope. Constants may only be set to a constant expression, not the results of a value that could only be computed at runtime. Rust's naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words. Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in which they were declared.

## Operations

Rust supports the basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer.

 [Appendix B](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-02-operators.html) contains a list of all operators that Rust provides.
 
## Variables

Variables in Rust are declared with the `let` keyword. Variable bindings are immutable by default, but this can be overridden using the `mut` modifier.

Variable bindings can be type annotated when declared. However, in most cases, the compiler will be able to infer the type of the variable from the context, heavily reducing the annotation burden.

Values (like literals) can be bound to variables, using the let binding.

### Shadowing

A variable can be shadowed by repeated use of the `let` keyword whether it is in the same scope following a previous use or in a nested scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

The above outputs:

```sh
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` because we'll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. When the `let` keyword is used again, it effectively creates a new variable, possibly with a different type, but with the same name.

## Ownership

Ownership is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory. All programs have to manage the way they use a computer's memory while running. Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If any of the rules are violated, the program won't compile. None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while it's running.

In other words, ownership enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.

The main purpose of ownership is to manage heap data.

### Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has an owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

## References

A reference is like a pointer in that itâ€™s an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.

Every reference in Rust has a lifetime, which is the scope for which that reference is valid. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred.

### The Rules of References

- At any given time, you can have _either_ one mutable reference _or_ any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

### Slices

Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

**String Slices**

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];
```

## Mutability

**Misc**

<dl>
  <dt>mutable reference</dt>
  <dd><code>&mut T</code>, can be used to borrow and mutate mutable data.</dd>
  <dt>immutable reference</dt>
  <dd><code>&T</code>, can be used to borrow data but not mutate it.</dd>
</dl>

## Lifetimes

A lifetime is a construct of the compiler (or more specifically, its borrow checker) uses to ensure all borrows are valid. Specifically, a variable's lifetime begins when it is created and ends when it is destroyed.

## Attributes

An attribute is metadata applied to some module, crate, or item. When attributes apply to a whole crate, their syntax is `#![crate_attribute]`, and when they apply to a module or item, the syntax is `#[item_attribute]` (notice the missing bang `!`).

Attributes can take arguments with different syntaxes:

- `#[attribute = "value"]`
- `#[attribute(key = "value")]`
- `#[attribute(key1 = "value", key2 = "value")]`
- `#[attribute(value)]`
- `#[attribute(value1, value2)]`

## Traits

A trait defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. Traits can be used to define shared behavior in an abstract way. Trait bounds can be used to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior.

Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called interfaces in other languages, although with some differences.

A typeâ€™s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.

```rust
use std::convert::From;

impl From<F> for T {
    fn from(f: F) -> Self {
        ...
    }
}
```

The `Into` trait is simply the reciprocal of the `From` trait.

```rust
use std::convert::Into;

impl Into<T> for F {
    fn into(self) -> T {
        T
    }
}
```

```rust
use std::fmt;

struct Circle {
    radius: i32
}

// Implementing the fmt:Display trait on the Circle struct.
impl fmt::Display for Circle {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Circle of radius {}", self.radius)
    }
}
```

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

// OR the same trait but with a default implementation.
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}

pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    // ...
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}

// **Trait Bounds**
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}

// **Multiple Trait Bounds**
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}

fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{ /* ... */ }

fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Flow Control

### for

```rust
let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
for item in a {
    println!("The value is: {item}");
}
```

### if/else

```rust
// Statement
if ... {
    ...
} else if ... {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}

// Expression
let something =
    if ... {
        ...
        some_value
    } else if ... {
        ...
        some_other_value
    } else {
        ...
        another_value
    };
//   ^ Don't forget to put a semicolon here! All `let` bindings need it.

let value = if ... { 42 } else { 13 };
```

### loop

**Typical**

```rust
loop {
    ...
    continue;
    ...
    break;
}
```

**Nesting and Labels**

```rust
'outer: loop {

    'inner: loop {
        // This would break only the inner loop
        // break;

        // This breaks the outer loop
        break 'outer;
    }

    println!("This point will never be reached");
}
```

**Returning from Loops**

```rust
let something =
    loop {
        ...
        break some_value;
        ...
    };
//   ^ Don't forget to put a semicolon here! All `let` bindings need it.
```

### while

```rust
while ... {
    ...
    continue;
    ...
    break;
}
```

## Error Handling

Rust groups errors into two major categories: recoverable and unrecoverable errors. Most languages donâ€™t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust doesnâ€™t have exceptions. Instead, it has the type `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and the `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an unrecoverable error.

### Propagating Errors

#### The `?` Operator

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username = String::new();
    File::open("hello.txt")?.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
    Ok(username)
}
```

Error values that have the `?` operator called on them go through the `from` function, defined in the `From` trait in the standard library, to convert it from one error type into the error type defined in the return type of the function.

The `?` operator can only be used in a function that returns `Result` or `Option` (or another type that implements `FromResidual`).

Note that you can use the `?` operator on a `Result` in a function that returns `Result`, and you can use the `?` operator on an `Option` in a function that returns `Option`, but you canâ€™t mix and match. The `?` operator wonâ€™t automatically convert a `Result` to an `Option` or vice versa; in those cases, you can use methods like the `ok` method on `Result` or the `ok_or` method on `Option` to do the conversion explicitly.

### The `main` Function

The `main` function may return any types that implement the `std::process::Termination` trait, which contains a function `report` that returns an `ExitCode`.

```rust
use std::process::Termination;

fn main() -> impl Termination {
    // ...
}
```

```rust
// This signature allows any error to be returned.
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // ... some code that may result in an error.
    Ok(())
}
```
