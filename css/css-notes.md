# CSS Notes


## Some New CSS Features

Here are some new (at least new to me) CSS psuedo-classes, pseudo-elements,
keywords, properties, rules, and values I recently came across.

### Implemented in at Least One Browser

**::backdrop**

The `::backdrop` CSS pseudo-element is a box rendered immediately below any
element rendered in fullscreen mode (and above any lower elements in the
stack) or a `dialog` element.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop for details.

```css
dialog::backdrop {
  background: rgba(255, 0, 0, .25);
}
```

**block-size**

The `block-size` CSS property defines the horizontal or vertical size of an
element's block, depending on its `writing-mode`.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/block-size for details.

```css
p {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
  block-size: 20em;
}
```

**box-decoration-break**

The `box-decoration-break` CSS property specifies how the `background`,
`padding`, `border`, `border-image`, `box-shadow`, `margin`, and `clip-path`
of an element are applied when the box for the element is fragmented.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-decoration-break for
details.

```css
div {
  box-decoration-break: clone;
}
```

**caret-color**

The `caret-color` CSS property sets the color of the insertion caret within an
element such as `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, or one with the
`contenteditable` attribute set.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caret-color for details.

```css
textarea {
  caret-color: red;
}
```

**contain**

The `contain` CSS property allows an author to indicate that an element and its
contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the document tree.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain for details.

```css
section {
  contain: strict;
}
```

**currentColor**

The `currentColor` keyword represents the value of an element's `color`
property.  This lets you use the `color` value on properties that do not
receive it by default.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentColor_keyword
for details.

```css
html {
  color: maroon;
}
p {
  border: 1px solid currentColor;
}
```

**display: contents**

See https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#box-generation for details.

```css
.wrapper {
  display: contents;
}
```

**:focus-within**

Represents an element that has received focus or contains an element that has
received focus.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within for
details.

```css
.Panel:focus-within {
  outline: 2px solid aqua;
}
```

**:fullscreen**

The `:fullscreen` CSS pseudo-class represents an element that's displayed when
the browser is in fullscreen mode.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:fullscreen for details.

```css
video:fullscreen {
  ...
}
```

**hypens**

The `hyphens` CSS property specifies how words should be hyphenated when text
wraps across multiple lines.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens for details.

```css
p {
  hypens: auto;
}
```

**inline-size**

The `inline-size` CSS property defines the horizontal or vertical size of an
element's block, depending on its `writing-mode`.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inline-size for details.

```css
p {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
  block-size: 20em;
  inline-size: 40em;
}
```

**object-fit**

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit for details.

```css
img,
video {
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

**object-position**

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position for
details.

```css
img,
video {
  object-position: center top;
}
```

**offset**

The `offset` CSS property is a shorthand property for animating an element
along a defined path.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/offset for details.

```css
offset: path(M 100 100 L 300 100 L 200 300 z);
```

**overscroll-behavior**

The `overscroll-behavior` CSS property allows you to control the browser's
scroll overflow behavior â€” what happens when the boundary of a scrolling area is
reached.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior for details.

```css
.ChatBox {
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}
```

**::placeholder**

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::placeholder for
details.

```css
input::placeholder,
textarea::placeholder {
  font: ...;
}
```

**:placeholder-shown**

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:placeholder-shown for
details.

```css
input:placeholder-shown,
textarea:placeholder-shown {
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

**scroll-behavior**

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior for
details.

```css
div {
  overflow-y: scroll;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

**text-decoration-<color|line|skip|style>**

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration for
details.

```css
.error {
  text-decoration: underline wavy red;
}
```

**text-emphasis**

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-emphasis for
details.

```css
h2.is-important {
  text-emphasis: open sesame red;
}
```

**touch-action**

The `touch-action` CSS property specifies whether, and in what ways, a given
region can be manipulated by the user via a touchscreen (for instance, by
panning or zooming features built into the browser).

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action for details.

```css
div {
  touch-action: pan-y;
}
```

**@viewport**

The `@viewport` rule is like a CSS alternative to
`<meta name="viewport" content="...">`.

See https://www.w3.org/TR/css-device-adapt/#atviewport-rule for details.

```css
@viewport {
  width: 320px auto;
}
```

**will-change**

The `will-change` CSS property provides a way for authors to hint browsers
about the kind of changes to be expected on an element, so that the browser
can set up appropriate optimizations ahead of time before the element is
actually changed.  These kind of optimizations can increase the responsiveness
of a page by doing potentially expensive work ahead of time before they are
actually required.  `will-change` is intended to be used as something of a
last resort.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change for details.

```css
.sidebar {
  will-change: transform;
}
```

**wrap-flow and wrap-through**

The `wrap-flow` and `wrap-through` properties are a part of the CSS Exclusions
module.  Exclusions defines how inline content flows around elements.  It
extends the content wrapping ability of floats to any block-level element.

```css
div {
  wrap-flow: clear;
  wrap-through: none;
}
```


## Block Formatting Context

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context
for details.

A block formatting context is the region in which the layout of block boxes
occurs and in which floats interact with each other.

A block formatting context is created by one of the following:

* The root element or something that contains it
* Floats (elements where `float` is not none)
* Absolutely positioned elements (elements where `position` is `absolute` or
  `fixed`)
* Inline-blocks (elements with `display: inline-block`)
* Table cells (elements with `display: table-cell`, which is the default for
  HTML table cells)
* Table captions (elements with `display: table-caption`, which is the default
  for HTML table captions)
* Block elements where `overflow` has a value other than `visible`.
* `display: flow-root`
* `column-span: all` should always create a new formatting context, even when
  the `column-span: all` element isn't contained by a multicol container.

A block formatting context contains everything inside of the element creating
it that is not also inside a descendant element that creates a new block
formatting context.

Block formatting contexts are important for the positioning and clearing of
floats.  The rules for positioning and clearing of floats apply only to things
within the same block formatting context.  Floats do not affect the layout of
things in other block formatting contexts, and clear only clears past floats
in the same block formatting context.


## Stacking Context

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context for details.

A stacking context is formed, anywhere in the document, by any element which is either

* The root element (HTML)
* [Positioned][position] (absolutely or relatively) with a `z-index` value other than `"auto"`
* `position: fixed` or `position: sticky`
* A flex item with a [`z-index`][z_index] value other than `"auto"`
* Elements with an [`opacity`][opacity] value less than `1`
* Elements with a [`mix-blend-mode`][mix_blend_mode] value other than `"normal"`
* Elements with any of the following properties with a value other than `"none"`:
  + [`clip-path`][clip_path]
  + [`filter`][filter]
  + [`mask`][mask], [`mask-image`][mask_image], [`mask-border`][mask_border]
  + [`perspective`][perspective]
  + [`transform`][transform]
* Elements with [`isolation`][isolation] set to `"isolate"`
* Elements with [`-webkit-overflow-scrolling`][webkit_overflow_scrolling] set to `"touch"`
* Specifying any attribute above in [`will-change`][will_change] even if you don't specify values for these attributes directly
