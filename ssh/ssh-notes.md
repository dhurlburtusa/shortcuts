# SSH Notes


## SSH Keys

An SSH key is an access credential, similar to a password, used in the SSH protocol. SSH keys grant, automate, and enable remote access to servers.

> While it is possible to manage your servers using password-based logins, it is
> often a better idea to set up and utilize SSH key pairs.  SSH keys are more
> secure than passwords, and can help you log in without having to remember long
> passwords.
