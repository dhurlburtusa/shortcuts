# Facebook SDK for JS Notes

The Facebook SDK for JavaScript provides a rich set of client-side
functionality that:

* Enables you to use the Like Button and other Social Plugins on your site.
* Enables you to use Facebook Login to lower the barrier for people to sign up
  on your site.
* Makes it easy to call into Facebook's Graph API.
* Launch Dialogs that let people perform various actions like sharing stories.
* Facilitates communication when you're building a game or an app tab on
  Facebook.

The SDK, social plugins and dialogs work on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
