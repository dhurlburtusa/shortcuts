# Google Calendar Notes


## Calendar

A calendar is a collection of related events, along with additional metadata such as summary, default time zone, location, etc. Each calendar is identified by an ID which is an email address. Calendars can have multiple owners.

A primary calendar is a special type of calendar associated with a single user account. This calendar is created automatically for each new user account and its ID usually matches the user's primary email address. It can be shared with other users.

In addition to the primary calendar, you can explicitly create any number of other calendars; these calendars can be modified, deleted, and shared among multiple users.

## Events

An event is an object associated with a specific date or time range. Events are identified by an ID that is unique within a calendar. Besides a start and end date-time, events contain other data such as summary, description, location, status, reminders, attachments, etc.

Google Calendar supports single and recurring events.

Events may also be timed or all-day.
