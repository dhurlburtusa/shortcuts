# Google Calendar Notes


## Calendar

A calendar is a collection of related events, along with additional metadata such as summary, default time zone, location, etc. Each calendar is identified by an ID which is an email address. Calendars can have multiple owners.


## Events

An event is an object associated with a specific date or time range. Events are identified by an ID that is unique within a calendar. Besides a start and end date-time, events contain other data such as summary, description, location, status, reminders, attachments, etc.

Google Calendar supports single and recurring events.

Events may also be timed or all-day.
