# JavaScript Web Components Notes

Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements â€” with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code. Put another way, web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Web components are based on four main specifications:

- Custom Elements
- Shadow DOM
- ES Modules
- HTML Template

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components for details.
