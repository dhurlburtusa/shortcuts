# JavaScript History API Notes

The DOM `Window` object provides access to the browser's session history through the `history` object. It exposes useful methods and properties that let you navigate back and forth through the user's history and manipulate the contents of the history stack.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API for details.
