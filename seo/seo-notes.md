# SEO Notes

SEO is a marketing discipline focused on growing visibility in organic (non-paid) search engine results.  SEO
encompasses both the technical and creative elements required to improve rankings, drive traffic, and increase
awareness in search engines.


## How Search Engines Operate

Search engines have two major functions: crawling and building an index, and providing search users with a ranked list
of the websites they've determined are the most relevant.

### Crawling and Indexing

Links allow the search engines' automated robots, called "crawlers" or "spiders," to reach the many billions of
interconnected documents on the web.

Once the engines find these pages, they decipher the code from them and store selected pieces in massive databases, to
be recalled later when needed for a search query.

### Providing Answers

When a person performs an online search, the search engine scours its billions of documents and does two things:
first, it returns only those results that are relevant or useful to the searcher's query; second, it ranks those
results according to the popularity of the websites serving the information.  It is both **relevance** and
**popularity** that the process of SEO is meant to influence.

**How do search engines determine relevance and popularity?**

Search engines typically assume that the more popular a site, page, or document, the more valuable the information it
contains must be.  This assumption has proven fairly successful in terms of user satisfaction with search results.

Popularity and relevance aren't determined manually.  Instead, the engines employ algorithms to sort the wheat from
the chaff (relevance), and then to rank the wheat in order of quality (popularity).

These algorithms often comprise hundreds of variables.  In the search marketing field, we refer to them as
"ranking factors."  Moz crafted a resource specifically on this subject:
[Search Engine Ranking Factors](https://moz.com/search-ranking-factors).


## Search Engine Friendly Design and Development

### Indexable Content

To perform better in search engine listings, your most important content should be in HTML text format.  Images, Flash
files, Java applets, and other non-text content are often ignored or devalued by search engine crawlers, despite
advances in crawling technology.  The easiest way to ensure that the words and phrases you display to your visitors
are visible to search engines is to place them in the HTML text on the page.  However, more advanced methods are
available for those who demand greater formatting or visual display styles:

* Provide alt text for images.
* Supplement search boxes with navigation and crawlable links.
* Supplement Flash or Java plug-ins with text on the page.
* Provide a transcript for video and audio content if the words and phrases used are meant to be indexed by the engines.
 
**Seeing your site as the search engines do**

Many websites have significant problems with indexable content, so double-checking is worthwhile.  By using tools like
Google's cache, [SEO-browser.com](http://www.seo-browser.com/), and the [MozBar](https://moz.com/mozbar/) you can see
what elements of your content are visible and indexable to the engines.  Take a look at Google's text cache of this
page you are reading now.

### Crawlable Link Structure

Just as search engines need to see content in order to list pages in their massive keyword-based indexes, they also
need to see links in order to find the content in the first place.  A crawlable link structure—one that lets the
crawlers browse the pathways of a website — is vital to them finding all of the pages on a website.

* That is, don't have orphaned pages.

**Reasons why pages may not be reachable**

* Submission-required forms.
* Links in unparseable JavaScript.
* Links pointing to pages blocked by the Meta Robots tag or robots.txt.
* Frames or iframes.
* Robots don't use search forms.
* Links in Flash, Java, and other plug-ins.
* Links on pages with many hundreds or thousands of links.
* Nofollow links (i.e., links with the `rel="nofollow"` attribute).

### Keyword Domination

One of the best ways to optimize a page's rankings is to ensure that the keywords you want to rank for are prominently
used in titles, text, and metadata.


## Factors that may Affect Search Ranks

* Better PageSpeed score.

**On-page Factors**

On-page factors all have to do with elements of your own website. They include technical set-up, the quality of your code, textual, and visual content, and user-friendliness of your site.

**Off-page Factors**

Off-page factors include things like links from other websites, social media attention, and other marketing activities outside your own website.
