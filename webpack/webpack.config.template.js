   * 2. The issuer: An absolute path to the file of the module which requested the
   *    resource.  It's the location of the import.

   * In a rule, the properties `test`, `include`, `exclude`, and `resource` are
   * matched with the resource and the property `issuer` is matched with the
   * issuer.
   *
   * When using multiple conditions, all conditions must match.
   *
   * **Rule Results**
   *
   * Rule results are used only when the rule condition matches.
   *
   * There are two output values of a Rule:
   *
   * 1. Applied loaders: An array of loaders applied to the resource.
   *
   * 2. Parser options: An options object which should be used to create the parser
   *    for this module.
   *
   * These properties affect the loaders: `loader`, `options`, `use`.
   *
   * The `enforce` property affects the loader category.  Whether it's a normal,
   * pre- or post- loader.
