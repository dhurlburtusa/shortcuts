# HTTP Feature-Policy Notes

The HTTP `Feature-Policy` header provides a mechanism to allow and deny the use of browser features in its own frame, and in content within any `<iframe>` elements in the document.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy, and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy/Using_Feature_Policy.
