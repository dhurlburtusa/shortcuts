# Validator.js Notes

A library of string validators and sanitizers.

**This library validates and sanitizes strings only.**

If you're not sure if your input is a string, coerce it using `input + ''`. Passing anything other than a string is an error.

See https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js.


## Installation

```sh
npm install validator
```
