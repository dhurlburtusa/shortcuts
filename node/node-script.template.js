# Node Script Template

This template contains a bunch of code snippets you may find useful in your next
node script.

Note: What is found here generally does not apply to library style code. Library
style code is usually characterized by the fact that a module only exports
declarations and does not have side-effects. Scripts, on the otherhand, do
generally have side-effects and usually don't export anything.
