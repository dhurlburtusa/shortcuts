# SPARQL Notes

SPARQL, a recursive acronym for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language, is an RDF query language. SPARQL 1.1 is a set of specifications that provide languages and protocols to query and manipulate RDF graph content on the Web or in an RDF store.

Supports:

- aggregation
- subqueries
- negation
- creating values by expressions
- extensible value testing
- constraining queries by source RDF graph
